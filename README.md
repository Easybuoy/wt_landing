Due to the large community, finding solutions to potential problems and reference material is much easier, even for a potential dev without a lot of experience who would like to contribute to Main Course. | [View Dependency](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

### Less

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. | [View Dependency](https://graphql.org/)
